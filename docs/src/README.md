### Build Troubleshooting Tips

In case you run into an issue of `forge` not being able to find a compatible version of solidity compiler for one of your contracts/scripts, you may want to install the solidity version manager `svm`. To be able to do so, you will need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system and with it the acompanying package manager `cargo`. Once that is done, to install `svm` run the following command:

```zsh
cargo install svm-rs
```

To list the available versions of solidity compiler run:

```zsh
svm list
```

Make sure the version you need is in this list, or choose the closest one and install it:

```zsh
svm install "0.7.6"
```
